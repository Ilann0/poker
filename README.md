# Poker Hand Simulator

This little program allows you to run poker simulations by giving it a hand only, or a hand and a full or partial flop. You can tweak the number of players up to 21, and the number of simulations to run up to 999 999 (although, above 10 000, it doesn't really change anything).  Just run 'main.py'.
